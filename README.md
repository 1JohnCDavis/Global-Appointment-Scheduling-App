# Global-Appointment-Scheduling-App
A windows desktop application designed for the consulting industry.  This app consists of a log-in form that can determine the user’s location and translate log-in and error control messages (e.g., “The username and password did not match.”) into the user’s language.  The system has the ability to add, update, and delete customer records in the MySQL database, including name, address, and phone number.  The user can then add, update, and delete appointments, capturing the type of appointment and a link to the specific customer record in the database.  The UI has a calendar that can be viewed by both week and month, depending on user preferences.  This app automatically adjusts appointment times based on user time zones and daylight saving time.    There are exception controls to prevent scheduling an appointment outside business hours, scheduling overlapping appointments, entering nonexistent or invalid customer data, and entering an incorrect username and password.  The application provides reminders and alerts 15 minutes in advance of an appointment, based on the user’s log-in location.  There are options to generate reports for the number of appointment types by month and the schedule for each consultant.  Finally, the app has the ability to track user activity by recording timestamps for user log-ins in a .txt file.  Each new record appends to the log file, if the file already exists.
